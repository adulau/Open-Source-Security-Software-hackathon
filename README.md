# Open Source Security Software Hackathon materials

This repository is a support repository for the [Open Source Security Software Hackathon](https://hackathon.hack.lu/) to
help organisers, participants and external people to support activities and keep track of
what has been done at each hackathon session.

The objective is also to support other hackathons willing to start their own and reuse the
materials/ideas.
